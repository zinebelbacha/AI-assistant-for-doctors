## **1. Chest X-ray Classification Model**

This model is a custom TensorFlow implementation for classifying chest X-ray images, leveraging the DenseNet121 architecture , fine tuned on a customized dataset.

### **Model Details**
- **Architecture**: DenseNet121
- **Pre-trained on**: CheXpert dataset
- **Input size**: 224x224 pixels
- **Number of classes**: 14 (common chest X-ray findings)



## **2. OCR & Classifier Model for Medical Report Analysis**

This model is designed to extract and analyze textual information from medical reports. It classifies the type of case based on the extracted information, identifying conditions such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, or normal cases.

### **Key Features**
- **OCR Capability**: Reads medical analyses and identifies relevant clinical findings.
- **Supported Conditions**:  
  - Tuberculosis  
  - Pneumonia  
  - Normal
